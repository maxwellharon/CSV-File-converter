## Installation
This script requires Python to be installed on the local machine. Please visit [Python.org](https://www.python.org/) to install or type `python3 --version` to verify it is already installed.

Once Python is installed, clone the project or download the [ZIP file](https://github.com/jhsu98/json-csv-converter/archive/master.zip) and extract manually.

## Usage
Place a JSON or CSV file within the same directory as the script. The JSON file must be an Array of Objects or Multidimensional Array.

Navigate to the directory where the script exists and begin by typing `python3 json-csv-converter.py`

Enter the name of the file (include the extension) when prompted.

The script will convert the file, creating a new file with the same basename. If the converted file's name exists a `(1)` will be added to the basename of the converted file.
